# THERMOCOUPLE-DATA-PROJECT-USING-SUPERVISED-LEARNING
This data project is based on the use of Supervised Learning- Regression Model for plotting a Thermoemf vs Temperature curve for Fe-Cu Thermocouple obtained for a dataset in the laboratory. The neutral Temperature obtained is determined by derivatives in python.
