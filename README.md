# THERMOCOUPLE-DATA-PROJECT-USING-SUPERVISED-LEARNING
This data project is based on the use of Supervised Learning- Regression Model for plotting a Thermoemf vs Temperature curve for Fe-Cu Thermocouple obtained for a dataset in the laboratory. The neutral Temperature obtained is determined by derivatives in python. 
The Thermoemf(E) varies with Temperature(T) as E=A*T+B*T**2 where A and B are determined by polynomialmodel devised by Supervised Learning.However,this model underfits the data,ie,high bias isencountered. To combat this, we regularize the dataset model by a biquadratic model, which fits our dataset just right. In this way,using ML, we have obtained certain desirable results.
